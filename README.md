## sonar-text-plugin

A free and open-source Community plugin for SonarSource's Sonarqube product that lets you create custom rules to flag issues in text files. Currently it supports raising issues by:
 * Using regular expressions to define & locate text
 * Scanning files of >500,000 bytes one line at a time
 * Using DOTALL regular expressions to match across several lines. This method only looks at the first 500,000 bytes of the file
 * Requiring that text matching regex 'A' be present any time that text matching regex 'B' is present in that same file (this one always uses the DOTALL approach)
 * Forbidding the presence of text matching regex 'A' in one set of files any time that text matching regex 'B' exists in another set of files. This can be run in single-line or DOTALL mode.

### Why use this plugin

The uses that I had in mind when building this were:

* Common software configuration mistakes get made in our (dev|test|prod).properties files frequently enough to warrant automated detection. Examples are:
 * JDBC URLs using server names or IP addresses when a DNS CName is more appropriate.
 * Fault-tolerant URLs used with active/active and active/standby infrastructure that list only one of the nodes when it should list all of them (tip: prefer using JNDI-like lookups instead of listing all nodes if you have more than a couple of pieces of software doing this).
 * See also <a href="https://github.com/racodond/sonar-jproperties-plugin">David Racodon's Java Properties plugin</a>. It is designed to understand Java Properties files and look for issues such as duplicate variable definitions and empty variable definitions.

* Create Sonar issues that flag library dependencies that have a known deficiency, mustn't be used outside of 'test' scope, or mustn't be used at all due to an organizational policy or licensing concern.
 * Build tools such as Maven typically have commands available to generate a list of direct and indirect dependencies. You could run that command prior to the Sonarqube scan, pipe the output to a text file, and maintain a set of rules that apply to that file.
 * This approach wouldn't "fingerprint" Jar libraries or use a public list of issues like OWasp's Dependency-Check does BUT it would give you an easy way to flag versions of libraries from your own portfolio that teams should not be using any more.

* Raise issues on usages of some construct (class, method, enumeration value, whatever) when a particular library dependency is present. This is useful when a known bug exists in the library that only presents if you're using some little-used feature of that library. This functionality enables you to highlight only the problematic cases so that teams don't spend time upgrading away from a buggy library version unnecessarily.

* If your projects contain a shell script that sets environment variables or that does some other work you could use this plugin to run a regular expression search of those files to detect occurrences of some known problematic practice. This might get you by until a shell scripting language plugin is available. Note that a python plugin is currently available. I'm not aware of available plugins for Korn or Bash shell scripts.

### To install the plugin:
1. Ctrl-F for "release" on this Github page and click that link
2. Download the plugin Jar file
3. Copy that Jar into your Sonar installation's "extensions/plugins" directory
4. Reboot Sonar

### To configure your first rule:
1. Log in to Sonar, go to Quality Profiles, find the new "Text (Community)" section, and create a new profile under that
2. Make the new Quality Profile the default Test profile
3. Add an initial rule to the new Quality Profile's ruleset. Do this by first finding the _inactive_ "Simple Regex Match" rule. Click on that rule.
4. Click the "create" button that appears next to the words "CUSTOM RULES" at the bottom of the rule definition
5. Define your rule and save it
6. Activate the new rule in a quality profile
7. Double-check to ensure that the list of extensions for the 'text' language includes the extension of the file that your rule is looking for.
8. Double-check to ensure that your "sonar.sources" path will include the file to be scanned. If this path is set to "src/main/java" then Sonar won't scan files at the root of your project or in "src/main/resources".

After you've done the above you'll be ready to run a scan and see the first rule work.


### A use-case that I don't plan to solve via this plugin

Truly understanding library dependencies & specifying rules about those dependencies in a build tool agnostic manner is out of scope. That fits better in a "sonar-dependencies-plugin" that'd understand library dependency reports such as the Maven dependency plugin generates (teach it to understand dependency reports from several popular build tools). That plugin would have a rule template to flag problematic dependencies. It might also expose a custom API that other Sonar plugins can reference when running their rules; for example, the Java plugin might let you apply both a PMD XPath expression and a library version check and only raise an issue when both 'match' (use of a known buggy method / maybe multithreaded use of a call known to be non-threadsafe / enabling a feature via a property that doesn't work properly if a certain library version is being used).

### Upgrade steps when moving to version 2.0.0

    Install new plugin version (requires restart)
    Edit the plugin configuration in the Sonarqube UI by copying any customized configuration values from the older plugin's configuration to the new one. For example, if you added and file suffixes to "sonar-text-plugin.file.suffixes" you'll need to copy those over to the "sonar.txt.file.suffixes" setting.
    Migrate your rules/quality profiles
        1. Export your quality profile
        2. Edit the resulting text file by replacing all occurrences of the "text" language key and "text" repository key with "txt".
        3. Import the edited file
    Uninstall old plugin (requires restart)
